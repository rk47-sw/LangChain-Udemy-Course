      "It's tough to narrow down the \"top 5\" as Italy has an incredible diversity of pasta dishes, and favorites vary widely by region and personal taste! However, here are five undeniably iconic, beloved, and widely recognized Italian pasta dishes that represent different styles and regions:\n",
      "\n",
      "1.  **Spaghetti alla Carbonara** (Lazio/Rome): A true Roman classic, often misunderstood outside of Italy. The authentic version is made with **guanciale** (cured pork jowl), egg yolks (sometimes whole eggs), Pecorino Romano cheese, and freshly ground black pepper. No cream, no onion, no garlic (traditionally). It's rich, savory, and incredibly satisfying.\n",
      "\n",
      "2.  **Lasagna al Forno** (Emilia-Romagna): A baked, layered pasta dish, usually featuring wide pasta sheets, a rich rag\u00f9 (meat sauce, typically Bolognese), b\u00e9chamel sauce, and Parmesan cheese. It's a comforting, hearty, and celebratory dish, with countless regional variations (e.g., pesto lasagna, vegetable lasagna).\n",
      "\n",
      "3.  **Tagliatelle al Rag\u00f9 (Bolognese)** (Emilia-Romagna): While \"Spaghetti Bolognese\" is popular worldwide, in Italy, the rich, slow-cooked meat sauce (rag\u00f9) from Bologna is traditionally served with wider, flatter egg pasta like tagliatelle, which better holds the sauce. It's a cornerstone of Italian cuisine, complex in flavor from a mix of meats, vegetables (soffritto), tomato, and sometimes milk or wine.\n",
      "\n",
      "4.  **Pasta all'Amatriciana** (Lazio/Rome): Another pillar of Roman pasta, Amatriciana uses **guanciale**, Pecorino Romano cheese, black pepper, and tomato (usually San Marzano). Some versions include a touch of white wine or chili pepper. It's a vibrant, tangy, and slightly spicy dish that beautifully balances its strong flavors.\n",
      "\n",
      "5.  **Cacio e Pepe** (Lazio/Rome): The ultimate minimalist pasta, showcasing the power of simple, high-quality ingredients and perfect technique. It's made with just Pecorino Romano cheese, black pepper, and the starchy pasta cooking water emulsified into a creamy, intensely flavorful sauce. It's deceptively simple but requires skill to master.\n",
